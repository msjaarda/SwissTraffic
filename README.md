# VBridge

This project aims to answer questions about the effect of road traffic on bridges in Switzerland. There are 2 primary data sources:
+ Weigh-in-Motion [WIM] Data
+ Swiss Automatic Road Traffic Counts [SARTC] Data

Road traffic data is treated/filtered and converted to axle point load data and combined with bridge influence lines to get bridge load effects.
This can be done with WIM data directly, or it can be with simulated vehicles (deriving properties from the WIM vehicles).

The main programs within this project are
+ *MATSim*
+ *MATSimWIM*
+ *MATSimAxles*
+ *MATSimDET*
